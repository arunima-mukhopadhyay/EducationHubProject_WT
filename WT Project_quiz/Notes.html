<h2 align="center"> Computer - Number System</h2>
<h3>
When we type some letters or words, the computer translates them in numbers as computers can understand only numbers. A computer can understand positional number system where there are only a few symbols called digits and these symbols represent different values depending on the position they occupy in the number.
A value of each digit in a number can be determined using:
1.The digit
2.The position of the digit in the number
3.The base of the number system (where base is defined as the total number of digits available in the number system).<br><marquee direction="right">

<h2 align="center">Decimal Number System</h2>
<h3>The number system that we use in our day-to-day life is the decimal number system. Decimal number system has base 10 as it uses 10 digits from 0 to 9. In decimal number system, the successive positions to the left of the decimal point represent units, tens, hundreds, thousands and so on.

<br>Each position represents a specific power of the base (10). For example, the decimal number 1234 consists of the digit 4 in the units position, 3 in the tens position, 2 in the hundreds position, and 1 in the thousands position, and its value can be written as
(1x1000)+ (2x100)+ (3x10)+ (4xl)
(1x103)+ (2x102)+ (3x101)+ (4xl00)
1000 + 200 + 30 + 4
1234
As a computer programmer or an IT professional, you should understand the following number systems which are frequently used in computers.
</h3><h2>Number System and Description</h2><h3>
1	Binary Number System
Base 2. Digits used : 0, 1

2            Octal Number System
Base 8. Digits used : 0 to 7

3            Hexa Decimal Number System
Base 16. Digits used : 0 to 9, Letters used : A- F
<h2>
Binary Number System</h2><h3>
Characteristics of binary number system are as follows:
1.Uses two digits, 0 and 1.
2.Also called base 2 number system
3.Each position in a binary number represents a 0 power of the base (2). Example 20
4.Last position in a binary number represents a x power of the base (2). Example 2x where x represents the last position - 1.

Example
Binary Number : 101012<br><marquee>

<h2 align="center"> Hexadecimal Number System </h2>
<h3>
Decimal and hexadecimal have 10 digits in common, so they can create a lot of similar-looking numbers. But 10 in hex is a wholly different number from that in decimal. In fact hex 10 is equivalent to decimal 16. We need a way to explicitly state whether a number we are talking about is base 10 or base 16 (or base 8, or base 2).

<h2 align="center">Counting in Hex</h2>
<h3>

Counting in hex is a lot like counting in decimal, except there are six more digits to deal with. Once a digit place becomes greater than 'F', you roll that place over to '0', and increment the digit to the left by 1.</h3>
