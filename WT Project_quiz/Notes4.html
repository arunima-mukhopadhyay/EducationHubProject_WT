<h3> In the English language, words can be considered as the smallest elements that have distinctive meanings. Based on their use and functions, words are categorized into several types or parts of speech.

<br><br>1.Noun
This part of a speech refers to words that are used to name persons, things, animals, places, ideas, or events. Nouns are the simplest among the 8 parts of speech, which is why they are the first ones taught to students in primary school.

Examples:

Tom Hanks is very versatile.
The italicized noun refers to a name of a person.
 <br><br>2. Pronoun
A pronoun is a part of a speech which functions as a replacement for a noun. Some examples of pronouns are: I, it, he, she, mine, his, hers, we, they, theirs, and ours.

Sample Sentences:

Janice is a very stubborn child. She just stared at me and when I told her to stop.
The largest slice is mine.
We are number one.
The italicized words in the sentences above are the pronouns in the sentence.
 <br><br>3. Adjective
This part of  a speech is used to describe a noun or a pronoun. Adjectives can specify the quality, the size, and the number of nouns or pronouns.

Sample Sentences:

The carvings are intricate.
The italicized word describes the appearance of the noun “carvings.”
<br><br>4. Verb
This is the most important part of a speech, for without a verb, a sentence would not exist. Simply put, this is a word that shows an action (physical or mental) or state of being of the subject in a sentence.

Examples of “State of Being Verbs” : am, is, was, are, and were

Sample Sentences:

As usual, the Stormtroopers missed their shot.
The italicized word expresses the action of the subject “Stormtroopers.”
 <br><br>5. Adverb
Just like adjectives, adverbs are also used to describe words, but the difference is that adverbs describe adjectives, verbs, or another adverb.

The different types of adverbs are:

Adverb of Manner– this refers to how something happens or how an action is done.
Example: Annie danced gracefully.
The word “gracefully” tells how Annie danced.
Adverb of Time- this states “when” something happens or “when” it is done.
Example: She came yesterday.
The italicized word tells when she “came.”
