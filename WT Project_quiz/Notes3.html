<h2 align="center"> English - Synonyms and Antonyms </h2>
<h3>Antonyms are two words that have opposite meanings. Synonyms are words that have the same or nearly the same meaning. Homonyms are words that are pronounced the same, and are sometimes spelled the same, but have different meanings.</h3>

<h2 align="center"> Science- Periodic table </h2>
<h3>The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, ordered by their atomic number (number of protons), electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties. This ordering shows periodic trends, such as elements with similar behaviour in the same column. It also shows four rectangular blocks with some approximately similar chemical properties. In general, within one row (period) the elements are metals on the left, and non-metals on the right.

The rows of the table are called periods; the columns are called groups. Six groups (columns) have names as well as numbers: for example, group 17 elements are the halogens; and group 18, the noble gases.</h3>

<h2 align="center"> Maths- Algebra </h2>
<h3> Did you realize that the word "algebra" comes from Arabic (just like "algorithm" and "al jazeera" and "Aladdin")? And what is so great about algebra anyway? This tutorial doesn't explore algebra so much as it introduces the history and ideas that underpin it.the part of mathematics in which letters and other general symbols are used to represent numbers and quantities in formulae and equations.</h3>
